Question 1:<br>
The datasets are read using read_csv() <br>
Sex andEmbark is replaced with numerical values for finding the correlation <br>
Heatmap shows the correlation and Sex has the highest value of the correlation <br>
We need to keep the "Sex" feature because it has high correlation with survived which is the feature which is to be found<br>
Accuracy_score() is used to find the accuracy <br>
Question 2:<br>
Train_test_split() is used to split the training and testing data.<br>
random state=0 will give the same testing and training split every time.<br>
Question 3:<br>
Naive Bayes has more accuracy than the support vector machine from the above because the features given are independent and there is no linear separation boundary<br>
